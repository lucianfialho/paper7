{{ISSUE_BODY}}

# CONTEXT

Read the diff carefully:

{{REVIEW_COMMANDS}}

- Relevant tests and modules touched by the diff

Apply the repository and workspace instructions already loaded by the agent.

# REVIEW PROCESS

Before reviewing, use the `improve-codebase-architecture` skill on the files affected by this branch. Scope its recommendations to this issue's changed files only; do not start unrelated architecture work.

Look for bugs, regressions, missing edge cases, and avoidable complexity.

Stress changed code paths with hostile cases where relevant:

- Empty values
- Missing optional fields
- Rapid repeated calls
- Resource cleanup and interruption
- Adjacent behavior regressions

Improve code only when it preserves behavior and materially improves clarity, safety, or tests.

# EXECUTION

- Run relevant tests/checks first if practical.
- Add missing semantic tests when the diff has uncovered risk.
- Fix real issues directly on this branch.
- Preserve exact intended behavior.
- Do not modify `.sandcastle`.
- Commit review changes only if you made changes.

If code is already clean, tested, and safe, do nothing.

When complete, output {{COMPLETION_SIGNAL}}.
