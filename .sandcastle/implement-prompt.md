# CONTEXT

Before implementing, use the `tdd` skill. Follow its red-green-refactor workflow for this issue.

Follow the repository and workspace instructions already loaded by the agent.

Use local code search to find the smallest relevant surface area. Pay close attention to tests near changed code.

# EXECUTION

- Make minimal, surgical changes.
- Preserve type safety: no `any`, no non-null assertions, no type assertions.
- Use Effect v4 APIs and repo patterns for async, resourceful, or fallible code.
- Add deterministic tests for acceptance criteria when behavior changes.
- Prefer red-green-refactor for bug fixes and behavior changes.
- Do not modify `.sandcastle`.

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Run relevant checks before committing. Prefer narrow checks first, then broader checks if practical:

- `bun run build`
- `bun run test`

# COMMIT

Commit your changes with a concise conventional commit message. If `.jj/` exists, use `jj describe`; otherwise use `git commit`.

If the task cannot be completed, commit only complete safe work and explain blockers in the final output.

When complete, output {{COMPLETION_SIGNAL}}.

# FINAL RULES

Only work on this issue. Do not start adjacent work.
